 <h2> Description of dish</h2>

    <p>Succulent compressed meat shapes of kibble, paradoxically dry yet moist as well.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Kibble</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Look for bag of kibble</li>
        <li>If bag of kibble is unopened, open it with a pair of scissors or tearing it open with your teeth, creating a hole no greater than 5cms big.    </li>            
        <li>Locate Whiskey's kibble bowl</li>
        <li>Hold kibble bag up, over whiksey's kibble bowl, so that the hole in the bag is lower than the rest of the bag.  You should find that the kibble will drop out of the bag into Whiskey's bowl.</li>
        <li>If no kibble is coming out, check the bag to ensure that there is in fact a hole in the bag.  If there isn't a hole, then repeat step relating to cutting a hole in the bag.  If there is a hole but no kibble is coming out, gently poke a finger into the hole to see if there is a blockage of kibble.  Due to the irregular shape of kibble, sometimes kibble can lock together and form a tight bond, stronger than concrete, and the kibble will not fall. If this happens to be the case, poke into the hold harder but make sure to keep your eyes clear as you don't want a piece of kibble energised by stored kibble bonding concrete energy, to fly out of the bag into your eye and injure yourself forcing you to interrupt kibble preperation to have to sit for hours at the eye hospital.  Remember that one time when the hot water wasn't running and you went to check the tap and you turned it on and no water was running, but then you looked into the tap as if you could see what was wrong by doing so, and then all of a sudden scalding hot water started pouring out of the tap and you burnt your eye and much of the skin around it? </li>
        <li>Assuming you have managed to pour kibble out of the bag, pour kibble into Whiskey's bowl so that the kibble forms a pleasing kibbly mound. </li>
        <li>Call out to Whiskey to let her know that kibble is served.</li>
        <li>If she doesn't come to you wait for a moment.</li>
        <li>If after a moment, she still doesn't cone, then spend anywhere up to 4-6 hours going from room to rooom, calling out 'Whiskey!  Dama!  Cato! Wikki Poo!  Floof toob! Where are you??? Dry kibble for you in your bedroom!</li>
        <li>If you still have not located her, accept that she is doing her own thing and she will come to eat kibble when she is hungry.  Appreciate that the world is made up of many different individuals who all have their own needs and desires, and that however strong your desire to have Whiskey eat her kibble, when she chooses to meet her needs may not necessarily correspond with when you would like her to.  And recognise that this doesn't amount to a rejection of your offering, that she is appreciative of your service. And take this opportunity to have faith that you are motivated by an act of service to others and that itself should be its own reward and that Whiskey will eat some kibble when she feels like it. Use this opportunity to step back a little from your own immediate emotional and pscychological needs, and appreciate a different framework where your acts and your intentions operate on a time frame that is personal to you - and yet, because we are all connected, have faith that they do in fact impact upon the world and make it a better place for you and for others. </li>
