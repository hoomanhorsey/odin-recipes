    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chicken, raw</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Go to shop or send Ma to shop</li>
        <li>Look for refridgerated meat section</li>            
        <li>Find packet of refridgerated breast fillet chicken</li>
        <li>Purchase packet of chicken</li>
        <li>Go home</li>
        <li>Once home, wash your hands after being outside in a public shop where god knows who touched what.  Go to the toilet if you need to.  Have a little rest but DON'T HAVE A NAP otherwise you'll have such a difficult time falling asleep later that night. </li>
        <li>Once rested, heat a non-stick frypan</li>
        <li>While frypan is heating, cut chicken breasts into large pieces approximately 5cm long,</li>
        <li>Fry chicke. Do not add any oil. Fat from chicken is sufficient.</li>
        <li>Fry until chicken is cooked through. Cut a piece in half to determine whether there are any pink bits.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, let cool. And then place in refridgerator.</li>
        <li>The next day or up to 3 days later, take chicken out of the fridge and select about 3-4 pieces.  Cut into 1-2cm chunks and place into Whiskey's favourite bowl</li>
        <li>Heat in the microwave, covered, for 20 seconds. Once finished, check to ensure the chicken is warm, but cool enough to heat without burning.</li>
        <li>Call Whiskey over and serve</li>
