 <h2> Description of dish</h2>

    <p class="description">Mmmmm...delicious penne with a tomato napoli sauce, reheated in the microwave</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Penne</li>
        <li>Napoli sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>The previous day, boil enough penne pasta for a bowl of napoli penne pasta.</li>
        <li>If buying 80c pack store brand pasta, make sure it doesn't overcook as it starts disintegrating before it seems to even get a chance to get al dente.</li>            
        <li>Make a simple napoli type sauce, involving canned tomatoes, olive oil, salt, pepper, basil and chill flakes.</li>
        <li>Once you've made the pasta put it into a container and put it in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Once you've made the sauce, to save on washing up, place the entire saucepan in the fridge.</li>
        <li>Wait a day. Or two or three. Anywhere probably up to a week is okay, but beyond that is perhaps pushing it.  But it does somewhat depend on how busy your week has been. If it's 8 days it's probably not ideal, but just do a visual check and a sniff test.  Just because there's not visble mould on the sauce doesn't meant that it hasn't strated growing. But if you're healthy, and you're really tired, and you're really hungry, it could be worth a shot. What's the worse that could happen?  (Answer - Unintentional death, preceded by experiencing prolonged intestional pain, punctuated by moments of false hope where recovery seems possible and indeed imminent, but where ultimately the infection or toxicity has reached a threshold where no recovery is possible and where you become acclimatised to this suffering such that you are able to reach a level of acceptance of your ending, a humble appreciation of the life you've led, the people you've loved and who have loved you, the things you've achieved and wonderful experiences you've had such that you feel oblivion envelop you but you face it with a smile on your face.) </li>
        <li>Place pasta into a bowl heat in the microwave for about to minute.</li>
        <li>Pour the napoli sauce generously over the pasta and then heat in the microwave anywhere up to 5 minutes. Check every now and then to ensure that the microwave hasn't nuked the dish and all that is left are dessicated remains.
        <li>Once it is heated evenly through, serve and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
